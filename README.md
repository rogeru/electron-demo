# electron-demo

[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) demo app based on [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start), but additionally:
* Adds tray and context menu
* Sends text message using [Circuit SDK](https://github.com/circuit/circuit-sdk)
* Initiated a call using Circuit SDK
* Packaging for Mac, Win, Linux


Note: If you are serious about creating an application that needs to be signed, support auto-updates and maybe even distributed to the app stores I recommend to use electron-builder instead the individual packaging and installer modules.
